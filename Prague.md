- Svíèková: If you want an authentic Czech dish, this is it at its most incomprehensible. The dish is made up of beef sirloin and dumplings smothered in a creamy carrot sauce, before being garnished with cranberries and whipped cream. In English, the name translates to something like "candle sauce," as it used to only be eaten after dark.
- Goulash: This one is Hungarian originally, but the Czech Republic is crazy for goulash, and these days it's pretty hard to find a pub that doesn't have a plate of stew somewhere on the menu.
- Knedlo-vepøo-zelo: This dish is literally called porko-dumplo-cabbo. There's a bit of pork, a bit of dumpling, and a bit of, you know, cabbo. We're a simple people, and we like our meals greasy and filling.
- Buns and Vanilla Sauce: As children, we all watched communism vanish with a face full of little buns smothered in a thick vanilla sauce. Adults also order them when they're feeling depressed—but you get to eat them while you're happy because you're on holiday.
